**Problem statment**

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

**Task:** 

You are a data analyst who has been provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard to work on the following task. You can download all relevant documents from the download section.

1. Create the metrics according to the metric list.
2. Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
3. Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.


## Solution

**1. Data modelling**

The data model has two fact tables, and the respected connections were established.

**2. Dashboarding**
